# Configuration

AUTOCORRECT=Auto Correct
AUTOCORRECT DESC=Enter strings which will be changed automatically as you type, as a list of pairs separated by semicolons (eg: a^=â;i&quot;=ï).  These strings will only be changed when they are the last characters in the input box, and you do not press any key for half a second.
BACKTICKS=Change Single Quotes
BACKTICKS DESC=Automatically change any single quote character to backticks (this helps with javascript compatibility)
GLOBAL CHANGES=Apply changes in all translation files
GLOBAL CHANGES DESC=When you change a translation, this will automatically search every other translation file for an identical key-phrase pair, and apply the same change.  This can sometimes take a few seconds, especially if you have made many changes to long translations.
REF LANG=Reference Language
REF LANG DESC=Choose the reference language.  This should be a complete translation, so generally you should use 'en-GB'.  You can use the default language for the administrator instead.
REVERSE (BACKTICK TO SINGLE-QUOTE)=Reverse (Backticks to Single Quotes)
SEARCHSTYLE=Search Style
SEARCHSTYLE DESC=A CSS style definition which will highlight the search terms when you are viewing the contents of a language translation file.
YES (SINGLE-QUOTE TO BACKTICK)=Yes (Single Quotes to Backticks)
ZIPPATH=Package File
ZIPPATH DESC=The path and filename to be used when creating an installation package.  The tokens [client] [tag] and [version] will be changed automatically to the relevant values.  You can translate the language tag using a token in the format [tag=xx-XX] - the selected files will be renamed in the archive file, together with relevant XML values. The package file format will be taken from the file ending - tested with .zip, but Joomla! should also support bzip2 gzip and tar.
